# Compliance Review

Evaluate your application against industry-specific regulatory requirements. This review translates dense compliance frameworks into concrete, testable technical checks — and validates them through browser-based testing. Non-compliance can result in severe fines, legal action, and loss of business.

## When to use

Use this review when:
- Building applications for regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government)
- Preparing for a compliance audit (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- Adding payment processing or health data features
- Expanding to GDPR-regulated markets
- After infrastructure or architecture changes that affect data handling

## Standards Referenced

- **HIPAA** — Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Technical Safeguards §164.312)
- **SOC 2** — Service Organization Control (Trust Service Criteria)
- **PCI-DSS v4.0** — Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **GDPR** — General Data Protection Regulation (Technical Measures)

## Phase Overview

```
Phase 1: EDUCATE   → Compliance context and applicable frameworks
Phase 2: SCOPE     → Determine which frameworks apply, identify regulated data
Phase 3: ANALYZE   → Browser-based checks against framework requirements
Phase 4: REPORT    → Findings mapped to specific regulatory sections
Phase 5: REMEDIATE → Fix guidance + YAML regression tests for continuous compliance
```

---

## Phase 1: Educate

> **Why this matters:** HIPAA violations: up to $1.9M per violation category per year. PCI-DSS non-compliance: $5,000-$100,000/month in fines plus liability for breaches. SOC 2 failures: loss of enterprise customers who require it. GDPR: up to 4% of global annual revenue. These aren't theoretical — enforcement is active and increasing.

Compliance frameworks are large documents. This review extracts the **technical requirements testable in a web application** — not the organizational/procedural requirements (policies, training, vendor management) that require human process review.

---

## Phase 2: Scope

### Determine applicable frameworks

1. **Auto-detect from codebase:**
   - Health data handling (HIPAA indicators: HL7, FHIR, patient records, PHI references)
   - Payment processing (PCI-DSS indicators: Stripe, Braintree, credit card fields, payment forms)
   - EU user data (GDPR indicators: consent banners, cookie notices, EU deployments)
   - Audit logging (SOC 2 indicators: audit trail, event logging, access logs)

2. **Ask the user:**
   - **Which frameworks apply?** (auto-detected, confirm)
     - [ ] HIPAA — healthcare / protected health information
     - [ ] SOC 2 — enterprise SaaS / customer data
     - [ ] PCI-DSS — payment card data
     - [ ] GDPR — EU personal data
     - [ ] Other (specify)
   - **Target URL**: Where is the app running?
   - **Regulated data types**: What regulated data does the app handle? (auto-detected)
   - **Test credentials**: Accounts with access to regulated data for testing

3. **Map regulated data flows:**
   - Where regulated data enters the system (forms, APIs, imports)
   - Where it's displayed (dashboards, reports, exports)
   - Where it's stored client-side (if anywhere)
   - Where it's transmitted (API endpoints, third-party services)

## Phase 3: Analyze

Run only the sections applicable based on Phase 2 scoping. Open a browser session with `new_session` using `record_evidence: true`.

### HIPAA Technical Safeguards (HIP)

Applicable when: application handles Protected Health Information (PHI).

| Check ID | Check | HIPAA Section | Method |
|----------|-------|---------------|--------|

### PCI-DSS v4.0 (PCI)

Applicable when: application processes, stores, or transmits cardholder data.

| Check ID | Check | PCI-DSS Req | Method |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| PCI-01 | Credit card numbers never fully displayed | 3.4 | View saved cards, verify masking (show last 4 only) |

### GDPR Technical Requirements (GDPR)

Applicable when: application handles EU personal data. (Note: privacy-specific checks are in the privacy review — this section covers GDPR's technical/compliance obligations.)

| Check ID | Check | GDPR Article | Method |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------|

## Phase 4: Report

Generate a structured report saved to `shiplight/reports/compliance-review-{date}.md`:

```markdown
# Compliance Review Report
**Date:** {date}
**URL:** {url}
**Frameworks evaluated:** {HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, GDPR}
**Regulated data types:** {PHI, cardholder data, EU personal data}

## Overall Compliance Score: {X}/10 | Confidence: {X}%

## Framework Scores
| Framework | Score | Pass | Fail | N/A | Critical Gaps |
|-----------|-------|------|------|-----|---------------|
| HIPAA | 6/10 | 8 | 3 | 1 | Session timeout, PHI in URL |
| SOC 2 | 7/10 | 9 | 2 | 1 | No MFA, weak audit trail |
| PCI-DSS | 8/10 | 10 | 1 | 1 | Card data in console |
| GDPR | 5/10 | 5 | 4 | 1 | Consent, data export, erasure |

## Compliance Status by Check
(Full table of all checks with PASS/FAIL/N-A status, evidence, and confidence)

## Critical Non-Compliance Items
(Findings that could result in regulatory action, ordered by risk)

## Audit Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Fix all CRITICAL findings
- [ ] Fix all HIGH findings
- [ ] Document accepted risks for MEDIUM findings
- [ ] Run YAML regression tests before audit date
- [ ] Prepare evidence documentation from this report
```

### Confidence Scoring
- **90-100%**: Browser-validated, compliance violation confirmed (e.g., PHI visible without auth, card number in console)
- **70-89%**: Strong evidence from inspection (e.g., missing header, no timeout behavior)
- **50-69%**: Architectural concern based on code patterns (e.g., audit logging might be incomplete)
- **Below 50%**: Don't report — compliance findings must be substantiated

---

## Phase 5: Remediate

### 1. Fix guidance (example)
```markdown
#### HIP-02: No session auto-timeout
**Regulation:** HIPAA §164.312(a)(2)(iii) — Automatic logoff
**Risk:** Unattended sessions with PHI visible
**Current:** Sessions persist indefinitely
**Fix:** Implement idle timeout (HIPAA recommends ≤15 minutes for PHI access)
- Add client-side idle detection (mouse, keyboard events)
- Server-side session expiry as backup
- Show warning dialog at 12 minutes
- Auto-logout and clear screen at 15 minutes
```

### 2. YAML regression test
```yaml
# regression: hip-02-session-auto-timeout · HIPAA-164.312(a)(2)(iii) · severity critical
goal: Verify session auto-timeout for HIPAA compliance
base_url: https://staging.example.com
statements:
  - URL: /login
  - intent: Log in with test credentials
    action: fill
    locator: "getByLabel('Email')"
    value: "test@example.com"
  - intent: Enter password
    action: fill
    locator: "getByLabel('Password')"
    value: "testpass123"
  - intent: Submit login form
    action: click
    locator: "getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' })"
  - WAIT_UNTIL: Dashboard with PHI is visible
    timeout_seconds: 15
  - VERIFY: Session timeout warning appears after inactivity period
    timeout_seconds: 900
  - VERIFY: User is automatically logged out after timeout expires
    timeout_seconds: 300
```

Author these as Shiplight YAML via `create-yaml-tests`, saved under `tests/` (see `report-format.md`).

## Depth Levels

- **`--quick`**: Critical checks only — authentication boundaries + data exposure. ~3 minutes.
- **default**: Full applicable framework. ~10-15 minutes.
- **`--thorough`**: All checks + multi-role testing + edge cases + documentation review. ~25-40 minutes.

## Tips

- Run the compliance review specific to your framework: "run HIPAA checks only"
- Compliance requires evidence — use `record_evidence: true` and `generate_html_report` for audit documentation
- YAML regression tests from this review serve as continuous compliance monitoring
- This review covers technical requirements only — organizational requirements (policies, training) need human review
- For privacy-specific concerns, complement with the privacy review (`/review privacy`)
- For security-specific concerns, complement with the security review (`/review security`)
- Close session with `close_session` and use `generate_html_report` for evidence
