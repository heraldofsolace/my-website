# Shiplight

The single entry point for Shiplight QA work. This skill takes a **subcommand**
and routes it to the right workflow. Everything Shiplight-branded comes through
here; the description above is deliberately gated so this skill fires only when
the user names "shiplight" or types `/shiplight` — never on a generic "write a
test".

## Routing contract

1. **Identify the subcommand.** Match the argument against the dispatch table —
   do **not** rely on the first token alone, because synonyms are often multi-word
   (`yaml test`, `set up tests for my app`) and intents may lead with a non-token
   word (`create yaml test`, `show failing tests`). In order: (a) an exact
   canonical token as the leading word; (b) the longest canonical-token or synonym
   **phrase** the argument contains; (c) overall intent against the synonym/intent
   column. Pick the single best-matching subcommand.
2. **Pass-through context.** Forward whatever the selector didn't consume to the
   subcommand as context. **Natural phrasing is expected — users won't type the
   exact hyphenated token; match the intent and treat the rest as the target.**
   Examples:
   - `/shiplight cover checkout flow` → `cover` + context `checkout flow`
   - `/shiplight create a yaml test for login` → `create-yaml-tests` (matched on
     "yaml test") + context `for login`
   - `/shiplight create agent verification for the signup flow` →
     `create-agent-verification` (matched on "agent verification") + context
     `for the signup flow`
3. **Dispatch.** Read the matching `references/<subcommand>.md` (or
   `references/<subcommand>/index.md` for nested subcommands) and follow it,
   carrying the context forward.
4. **Clarify, don't guess.** If the selector is empty (`/shiplight` alone) or
   ambiguous (see Ambiguity notes), show the menu and ask **one** clarifying
   question — the user wants to *act* but didn't say how. This differs from
   `help`, which is informational: `help` lists/explains subcommands and **never
   executes** (see `references/help.md`).
5. **Confirm destructive actions.** Never auto-run `init` against a non-empty
   project — confirm first.

## Shared layer

- On every subcommand invocation (skip for `help` and `support`), identify the test project
  root, then run `references/_shared/update-check.md` once (daily skill refresh +
  `shiplightai` CLI version gate). It can **halt** the run: a CLI behind the
  latest published version stops the subcommand before it starts, and offers an
  upgrade.
- Each subcommand names the `references/_shared/` modules it needs (auth, mcp,
  evidence-and-report, project-layout, ground-truth, knowledge, secrets,
  vocabularies, test-spec-template). Read those before acting — they are the
  single source of truth, not restated per subcommand.

## Subcommands (menu)

Show this grouped menu when invoked bare or when clarifying.

**Setup**
- `init` — scaffold a Shiplight test project + write `specs/context.md`
- `auth` — set up / repair login and saved storage state
- `update` — refresh installed Shiplight skills + the `shiplightai` CLI

**Author**
- `create-yaml-tests` — implement deterministic YAML E2E tests from a spec
- `create-agent-verification` — create a reusable agent-run verification script
- `cover` — decide test format + effort, plan, drive the producers, report

**Maintain**
- `fix` — reproduce and repair failing or drifted tests

**Check**
- `verify` — verify UI changes in the browser during local development

**Review**
- `review` — app-quality review (security, privacy, design, performance, …)

**Ship**
- `ci` — wire CI workflows + failure-triage pipeline
- `cloud` — read Shiplight Cloud (Nova) test results (runs, failing/flaky tests, artifacts) and analytics (health summary, pass-rate/run trends, slowest/flaky rankings, failure attribution)

**Help**
- `help` — list subcommands, or `help <subcommand>` for details (does not execute)
- `support` — get human help: file a support ticket with session diagnostics, check replies

End the menu with one footer line:
`Stuck? /shiplight support reaches a human — the ticket drafts itself from this session.`

## Ambiguity notes

- **"test" / "write a test"** → could be `create-yaml-tests` (deterministic, UI
  focused) or `create-agent-verification` (spans UI **and** backend state). Default
  to `create-yaml-tests` unless the user signals a core journey, backend/
  cross-layer proof, release smoke, or live-env judgment — but if unclear, ask.
- **"smoke test"** → ambiguous alone. A quick UI pass over key screens is
  `create-yaml-tests`; a pre-release check that a core journey works **and** left
  the right backend state is `create-agent-verification`. Ask which, unless the
  user names a backend expectation or a release gate.
- **"verify" / "verification"** → the *verb* (check a change now) is `verify`;
  *creating a reusable verification script* is `create-agent-verification`. The
  `create-` framing is the tell. Ask if the user's phrasing doesn't disambiguate.
- **"triage"** → in Shiplight this means `fix` (repair failing tests). Do not
  confuse with `review`'s internal triage/plan step.
- **"failing tests" / "flaky tests"** → *reading* them from CI ("in the cloud",
  "from the last run", plural reporting) is `cloud` (Nova results); *repairing* a
  broken test ("my test is failing", "fix this") is `fix`. Ask if the phrasing
  doesn't say which.
- **"report a bug" / "X is broken"** → depends on *what* is broken. The user's
  app misbehaving is ground truth to report (`_shared/ground-truth.md`), not a
  subcommand; Shiplight itself misbehaving (skill, CLI, cloud API) is
  `support`. Ask if unclear which one the user means.

## After a subcommand completes or aborts (next-step suggestion)

After a subcommand's final report — including the report of an aborted run —
optionally append **one** next-step suggestion. Rules:

- **Evidence-only.** A suggestion must be triggered by something already
  observed during the run — the diff analyzed, the failure diagnosed, the
  project state read. Never run extra analysis (a new git diff, file scan, or
  browser session) just to decide a suggestion.
- **Silence is the default.** No trigger from the table → no suggestion line at
  all. Failure states mostly suggest nothing: the user's next step is fixing
  the product, not another Shiplight command. Suggestions fire on success —
  "you proved it works; now make that durable / continuous / visible." The one
  failure that does fire is the **Shiplight-side** failure row (`support`), and
  it fires wherever the run stops — a mid-run abort report counts.
- **Gate on the nature of the change.** When the run started from a code change
  that is backend-only or barely touches UI, suppress the browser-flavored
  suggestions (`verify`, `create-yaml-tests`, `review design`); `cover` (picks
  unit/contract/integration via its capability map) and
  `create-agent-verification` (cross-layer live checks) are the useful pointers
  there.
- **One line, statement not question.** Format:
  `Next: /shiplight <cmd> — <reason from this run>`. Never auto-run the
  suggested command; never ask a blocking yes/no. The user decides.
- **At most one suggestion** — two only when genuinely forked (e.g. `cover` vs
  `create-yaml-tests` by scope).
- **Skip entirely in CI / non-interactive mode**, and after `update` / `help` /
  `support`.

| After | Trigger observed during the run | Suggest |
|-------|--------------------------------|---------|
| `init` | app has login/authed routes | `auth`; otherwise `cover` |
| `auth` | invoked to unblock another command | resume that command; otherwise nothing |
| `verify` | passed on a meaningful flow with no YAML test covering it | `cover` (feature-level) or `create-yaml-tests` (single narrow flow) — verify is ephemeral, lock it in |
| `verify` | UI smells seen while driving: missing labels/roles, no `data-testid`s, brittle DOM, console warnings | `review design` (accessibility + testability) |
| `verify` | check failed, or the change was trivial | nothing |
| `fix` | diagnosis was **product change** and the change extends beyond the repaired tests | `cover <feature>` to refresh the testing-what spec |
| `fix` | repeated **locator drift** / no stable semantic hooks | `review design` (testability) — root-cause the drift instead of re-fixing every sprint |
| `fix` | repro came from a CI failure, or several tests shared one source | `cloud` to check blast radius / confirm the next run is green |
| `fix` | diagnosis was an **app bug** | nothing — report the bug (`_shared/ground-truth.md`) |
| `create-yaml-tests` | tests pass and no CI E2E workflow exists | `ci` |
| `create-yaml-tests` | flow's confidence needs API/DB/log state better judged than asserted | `create-agent-verification` |
| `create-agent-verification` | case `PASS` on a now-stable path **whose proof reduces to fixed conditions** | `create-yaml-tests` (promote to deterministic) — not when its worth is the judgment across evidence |
| `create-agent-verification` | `BLOCKED` on login/session bootstrap | `auth` |
| `cover` | produced Shiplight tests, no CI wiring | `ci` |
| `cover` | report rows `BLOCKED` on auth/env | `auth` |
| `review` | user fixed UI findings in-session | `verify` to confirm the fixes render |
| `review` | high-severity findings without regression coverage | `cover` |
| `ci` | workflow wired | push / open a PR to trigger it, then `cloud` for the first run's results |
| `ci` | no tests exist yet | `cover` first (precondition, per `ci/index.md`) |
| `cloud` | failing/flaky tests attributed `spec_issue` / drift | `fix` |
| `cloud` | attribution dominated by `app_regression` | nothing to run — an app bug to report |
| `cloud` | recorder sessions covering untested flows | `create-yaml-tests` from the recording |
| any | the run stopped on a **Shiplight-side** failure with no known fix — CLI crash, unexplained Shiplight API error, or the same step failing twice identically | `support` — the diagnostics for a ticket are already in this session |
